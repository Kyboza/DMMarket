    {id: 'merfolkArticle', content:'Merfolk in the Duel Masters universe are known not only for their powerful abilities but also for their graceful and captivating appearance. For Merfolk, beauty is more than just superficialâ€”its an essential part of their identity and magic. They believe that their elegance reflects their inner strength, and even in the heat of battle, their movements remain fluid and mesmerizing. This deep connection to beauty stems from their oceanic heritage, where harmony and balance with nature are prized above all else. In combat, Merfolk use their beauty to disarm and distract opponents, weaving it into their battle strategies. Their fighting style is as graceful as their appearance, relying on agility, precision, and cunning. They often use water-based magic, creating illusions or summoning waves to protect themselves or strike at enemies from a distance. This combination of grace, beauty, and deceptive tactics makes them a dangerous yet enchanting presence on the battlefield.'}
