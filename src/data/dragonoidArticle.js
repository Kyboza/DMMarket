    id: 'dragonoidArticle' , content: 'Dragonoids are a type of creature that originates from the Duel Masters trading card game, known for their association with dragons and elemental power. These fierce, dragon-like beings are often humanoid in appearance but possess characteristics of dragons, such as scales, claws, and the ability to harness fire. Though they are distinct from full-fledged dragons, Dragonoids share many of their traits, making them formidable fighters in the Duel Masters universe. Dragonoids are known for their raw power and agility, making them highly efficient in combat. Many Dragonoid cards in Duel Masters have abilities that allow them to attack rapidly or deal extra damage. Their affinity for fire gives them access to powerful destructive spells, which can quickly turn the tide of battle. Some notable Dragonoids also have synergy with dragon-type creatures, amplifying their strength when dragons are on the battlefield. Despite their strengths, Dragonoids are often more fragile than other, bulkier creatures in the Duel Masters universe. They tend to have lower defenses, making them vulnerable to well-timed counterattacks. Their reliance on aggressive, direct assaults also leaves them open to control strategies that can stifle their quick attacks or remove them from the battlefield before they can do significant damage.'
